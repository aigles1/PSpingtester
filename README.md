# PSpingtester
Powershell GUI ping tester<br />
Useful for quick network connection status without having to type in any commands or remember known good addresses.<br />
The reason for only allowing 1-6 pings is because Ctrl+C does not work with hybrid console/gui powershell scripts.<br />
Esc closes the script.<br />
If you need Ctrl+C support, use my console version [PSmenupingtester](https://github.com/aigles1/PSmenupingtester)
